# Welcome to Project 2 (Week 2!)Review

For this project we were preparing ourselves to be able to Gain experience using git via our CLI and Visual Studio Code (VSCode) Source Control and
Gain experience writing and executing non-web server Node.js JavaScript code


## Main TakeAway/Interesy From this Project:

- My main interest was the apesct when we had to use the CLI to process and create git files that we wanted to ignore and also commiting and staging changes through the CLI


### Displaying the "Source Control" and also the documentation message using the "Diff Split Screen"
